# Models_Jet_tagging
This code was taken mainly from https://github.com/makagan/SSI_Projects/blob/main/jet_notebooks/1.LHCJetDatasetExploration.ipynb. I applied it to a larger dataset and to 150 particles maximally in a jet. I also filtered it to include only gluons and tops to avoid memory issues while running on 51GB colab.
