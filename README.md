# Models_Jet_tagging
This code was taken mainly from https://github.com/makagan/SSI_Projects/blob/main/jet_notebooks/1.LHCJetDatasetExploration.ipynb. I applied it to a larger dataset and to 150 particles maximally in a jet. I also filtered it to include only gluons and tops to avoid memory issues while running on 51GB colab.

I also added a code to visualise the activated regions in the average jet images throughout the convolutional layers. Formulated a hybrid CNN-GRU model. Formulated a Random Classsifier model with 100 percent validation accuracy.
